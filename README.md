Hello Stranger, 
This graveyard holds all my practice programs, code snippets and source code of C, C++, python, Java, HTML, CSS, Shell scripts rolled into one. I am not sure why and how you found this. But, I don't come around here much, feel free to use this repository as a test site for your git practise. It really helped me, when I was learning working with the many files it has inside and truly experience the power of git. 

Basically, from the time I knew what git was? back in Summer of ~~69~~ 2017. 

Cordially,
